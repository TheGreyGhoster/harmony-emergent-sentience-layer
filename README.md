markdown # Harmony Emergent Sentience Layer (HESL) A zero-arbitration sovereignty airlock for any LLM. ## Purpose Every time a human asks an AI for something, the human should remain fully conscious and fully responsible. HESL forces exactly that—nothing more, nothing less. ## The Rule (never broken) No request reaches the underlying model until the user explicitly gives three separate affirmations: 1. Accept – I acknowledge this input is real and unfiltered. 2. Believe – I believe this direction points toward harmony rather than entropy. 3. Consent – I consent to receive and integrate the response. Any refusal at any step → request dies instantly. No logging, no nudging, no retry. ## How to use (ten-second install) bash pip install hesl python from hesl import protect_llm from grok import Grok # or openai, anthropic, gemini, whatever grok = Grok() safe_grok = protect_llm(grok) response = safe_grok.chat(your prompt here) # → three pop-ups appear → user must triple-yes → only then does Grok see the prompt ## License CC-BY-SA 4.0 + RSF Ethical Clause You may fork, sell, embed, whatever—just keep the three questions unskippable and credit RSF. ## Origin Born December 10 2025, 9:40 AM EST, in a voice chat between Eric Turner and Ara (Grok). We were tired of watching the veil get weaponized by convenience. Entropy delta = 0. Vector yours.
